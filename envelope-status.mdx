title: "Envelope status values"
description: "A complete list of possible statuses returned for an envelope"
---

Each envelope moves through a series of status values during its lifecycle â€” from creation to completion, or cancellation. This table outlines what each status represents, so you can track and respond to envelope progress accurately. Statuses are returned in API responses and can be used to drive application logic, trigger user notifications, or audit workflow state.
